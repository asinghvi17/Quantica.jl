# Manual

Welcome to the Quantica.jl manual!

Here you will read about using Quantica.jl to build and compute properties of tight-binding models. This includes

- Defining general lattices in arbitrary dimensions
- Defining generic tight-binding models with arbitrary parameter dependences
- Building Hamiltonians of mono or multiorbital systems by combining lattices and models
- Computing bandstructures of Hamiltonians using a range of solvers
- Creating "open Hamiltonians" by attaching self-energies of different types to Hamiltonians, representing e.g. leads
- Computing Green functions of Hamiltonians or open Hamiltonians using a range of solvers
- Computing observables from Green functions, such as spectral densities, current densities, local and nonlocal conductances, Josephson currents, critical currents, transmission probabilities, etc.


# Glossary
- `Sublat`: a sublattice, representing a number of identical sites within the unit cell of a bounded or unbounded lattice. Each site has a position in an `E`-dimensional space (`E` is called the embedding dimension). All sites in a given `Sublat` will be able to hold the same number of orbitals, and they can be thought of as identical atoms. Each `Sublat` in a `Lattice` can be given a unique name, by default `:A`, `:B`, etc.
- `Lattice`: a collection of `Sublat`s and a number `L` of `Bravais` vectors that define the periodicity of the lattice. A bounded lattice has `L=0` Bravais vectors.
